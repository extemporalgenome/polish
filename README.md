# polish

A small (toy) Reverse Polish Notation implementation. The core code is less
than 100 lines long.

polish uses float64 numbers throughout.

An example command-line program lives in the `calc` directory. Once compiled,
it can be run like:

`calc 1 2 + 4 \* 3 /`

Being that this is a toy/teaching implementation, polish is subject to change;
if polish ever stabilizes enough for production use, it will be found at
<github.com/xtgo/polish>.
